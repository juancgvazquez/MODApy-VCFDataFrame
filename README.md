** VCFDataFrame - Part of the MODApy Project **

The purpose of this library is to facilitate the handling and analysis of Variant Calling Files in Python,
providing an API in line with Pandas, which is a data analysis library.

--------------------
## Requirements:

The package was developed in Python 3.8, so that is the minimum requirement to run it. We are
making efforts to test it in other environments.
